Getting Yokai Watch Wibble Wobble (US) to work on rooted phone

Supporting YWWWUS was a rather hard task and consists of two parts:

 - Xposed Override: the easy one, Xposed Module overrides checkRoot() and h()
 - modified libSGF: the hard one, we need to remove all references to "su"
		    from the libSGF library

How to modify the lib, there are three ways. But before: download the YWWWUS
apk file and extract it using apktool.

You'll find the libraries in

	<apkfilename>/lib/<architecture/libSGF.so

a) using xdelta patches. in the directory delta/com.level5.ywwwus you'll find
   xdelta patches to be applied like:

	xdelta <delta-patch>  <original-lib> <modified-lib>

   for example with the armeabi libSGF:

	xdelta libSGF-armeabi.delta libSGF.so libSGF-mod.so

   with the armeabi-v7a libSGF:

	xdelta libSGF-armeabi-v7a.delta libSGF.so libSGF-mod.so

   or with the x86 libSGF:

	xdelta libSGF-x86.delta libSGF.so libSGF-mod.so

b) command line editor, like Vim or Emacs. simply open the library and search for
   all instances of "su" and replace with the two letters with something different
   like "st". BUT: you must not change the length of the string, else you'll
   destroy the library. Also don't change anything that where "su" is just part
   of another word like "result" or whatever (that should be obvious, but still).

c) hex editor. Open the library in a hex editor and change the hexcodes for all
   instances of "su" and replace with the two letters with something different
   like "st". BUT: you must not change the length of the string, else you'll
   destroy the library. Also don't change anything that where "su" is just part
   of another word like "result" or whatever (that should be obvious, but still).

Once you successfully modified the library use it to replace the original one in

	<apkfilename>/lib/<architecture/libSGF.so

rebuild the apk file using apktool

	apktool b <apkfilename>/

open the new apk located in

	<apkfilename>/dist/<apkfilename>.apk

with a zip program and copy the

	META-INF

folder from

	<apkfilename>/original/

into the new apk. Copy this apk to your device and install.

Now start Yokai Watch Wibble Wobble (US) on your rooted phone.
