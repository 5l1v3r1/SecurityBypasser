Supporting Yokai Watch Wibble Wobble (US) was a rather hard task
and consists of two parts:

 - Xposed Override: the easy one, Xposed Module overrides checkRoot() and h()
 - modified libSGF: the hard one, we need to remove all references to "su"
		    from the libSGF library

==== Automated modification of the libSGF library (Linux only) ====

First download the YWWWUS apk file.

Using automated patcher: in the directory patcher you'll find the script

	yokai-patcher.sh

execute it and give the name of the apk file as argument, for example

	./patcher/yokai-patcher.sh /home/user/YokaiWatchWibbleWobbleUS.apk

you need to have xdelta and zip installed. If everything goes fine, the script
will tell you that it succeeded and where the new Yokai-Root.apk is stored.

Copy this apk to your device and install it (or install using adb).

==== Manual Methods (all operating systems) ====

To modify the libray there are three ways. But first download the YWWWUS
apk file and extract it,  you'll find the library in

	<apkfilename>/lib/<architecture>/libSGF.so

If you encounter issues with apktool, try the supplied one the patcher directory.

Now proceed with one of the following a), b) or c).

a) using xdelta patches. in the directory patcher/delta/com.level5.ywwwus you'll find
   xdelta patches to be applied like:

	xdelta <delta-patch>  <original-lib> <modified-lib>

   for example with the armeabi libSGF:

	xdelta libSGF-armeabi.delta libSGF.so libSGF-mod.so

   with the armeabi-v7a libSGF:

	xdelta libSGF-armeabi-v7a.delta libSGF.so libSGF-mod.so

   or with the x86 libSGF:

	xdelta libSGF-x86.delta libSGF.so libSGF-mod.so

b) command line editor, like Vim or Emacs. simply open the library and search for
   all instances of "su" and replace the two letters with something different
   like "st". BUT: you must not change the length of the string, else you'll
   destroy the library. Also don't change anything where "su" is just part of
   another word like "result" or whatever (that should be obvious, but still).

c) hex editor. Open the library in a hex editor and change the hexcodes for all
   instances of "su" and replace the two letters with something different
   like "st". BUT: you must not change the length of the string, else you'll
   destroy the library. Also don't change anything where "su" is just part of
   another word like "result" or whatever (that should be obvious, but still).

Once you successfully modified the library use it to replace the original one in

	<apkfilename>/lib/<architecture>/libSGF.so

rebuild the apk file using apktool

	apktool b <apkfilename>/

open the new apk located in

	<apkfilename>/dist/<apkfilename>.apk

with a zip program and copy the

	META-INF/

folder from

	<apkfilename>/original/

into the new apk. Copy this apk to your device and install.

Now start Yokai Watch Wibble Wobble (US) on your rooted phone.
